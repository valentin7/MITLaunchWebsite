                            We look for students who show to us that they have what it takes to become successful entrepreneurs.
                            There are no minimum grade or activity involvement requirements.</p>

This equates to being in any grade of high school presently - freshman through senior, or grades 9 through 12. 
                            There are no minimum requirement of classes beyond this that you need to have taken prior to attending Launch.</p>

Work often extends into the evenings and weekends, varying to some degree on specific group needs. Weekday evenings and weekends may also include field trips and special events. We pack the four weeks with as many opportunities to learn as possible, so we expect you to be 100% focused on Launch. If you have friends or relatives in the area, we suggest you visit with them either before or after the program. On the very rare occasion that a student wants to leave campus with family or friends from outside of Launch, permission from parents must be arranged by contacting Launch administration at least 48 hours in advance.</p>

                            UScan Technologies is an RFID technology company that specializes in creating cutting edge self-checkout systems, supplying retailers with the competitive advantage they deserve. Once installed, the UScan system allows shoppers to checkout their items by simply walking onto a platform. Through RFID technology, the shoppers&#39; items will be scanned instantaneously by radio waves and show up on the nearby payment screen. After payment, customers can exit the store, hassle-free. By eliminating the need to individually scan an item's barcode through the help of a cashier, shoppers enjoy a more simple and convenient shopping experience. Likewise, stores can cut down on cost and allow employees to play a more immersive role with their customers. The use of RFID technology is inevitable, and UScan aims to spark this movement in the retail industry.

                            Online shoe shopping is a tricky business -- it is extremely unreliable and difficult to find comfortable shoes that accommodate particular foot structures without having the ability to try on the shoe in person. The uncertainty of online shopping results in lower customer satisfaction as well as decreased revenues. Approximately 33% of all online shoe purchases are returned due to incompatible fit. Our solution is FitNFind, an online technology that matches online shoe customers to the most compatible shoe. Our software extracts specific measurements from photos that shoppers upload of their feet. FitNFind can be utilized by online shoe retailers to make the shoe-shopping process quick, easy, and efficient.  FitNFind also serves as a powerful method of data collection for shoe manufacturers. FitNFind revolutionizes the online shopping experience for people who have special needs for their feet with new, integrated technology, makes the selling process efficient, and offers valuable information to manufacturers.

                            With albinism prominent in Nigeria, the lack of adequate and advanced sun protection leaves people out of the workforce and increases risk of skin cancer and premature death. Amadi Suncare builds its brand around solving this problem. At Amadi Suncare, we believe in stimulating growth through sustainability. Through our line of all-natural suncare products, we hope to target the needs of the Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability (LOHAS) market in the United States. We will reinvest a portion of our profits to create a constant stream of sunscreen for the growing population of people with albinism in Nigeria so that they can ultimately lead more productive, healthier, and longer lives.

                            Food sensitivity is a growing concern and decision criterion for people who choose to eat out. AnyMeal creates greater value and confidence in the restaurant experience by providing accurate and in-context dietary data about specific dishes for anyone who wants—or needs—to make food sensitive choices. AnyMeal is a lifestyle necessity for anyone with any diet, anywhere.  Our iPhone application currently showcases 50 Cambridge restaurants and their respective menus, including gluten-free and vegan metadata for the dishes. In the next month, we will roll out in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and then New York.  We are inspired by family members with food sensitivities to provide credible and accessible information, so that they and everyone can ultimately lead a better, healthier life.

                            Unbounded is a travel program designed to provide services to families affected by autism. In the United States, 1 out of every 88 children is diagnosed with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The characteristics of autism – sensory demands, transition difficulties, and communication challenges – often intimidate families from bringing their children into the community. Unbounded offers vacations for families affected by autism by partnering with hotels, providing staff for behavioral support, and designing positive leisure experiences through recreational therapy. We are on a journey to revolutionize the way individuals with autism and their families experience the world, and would love you to join us.

                            Of the 3 million students applying to college, 66% struggle with standing out, finding their voice and lack basic guidance throughout the college application process. To solve this problem, Essace offers trustworthy, affordable, and personalized mentorship throughout the college application process by connecting high school students to an undergraduate student at their school of choice based on similar interests. The Essace team includes a balanced and complementary skill set, from coding/web development to marketing and sales, enabling us to dynamically adapt our offering to meet the customer need.

                           Every year thousands of high school students struggle to find an impactful volunteering opportunity. As a result, students have to turn to performing tedious and mundane volunteer work. High School Super Heroes allows students to specify their skills and interests, allowing them to be matched with several potential volunteer organizations.  Ultimately, our program will help students find organizations they are passionate about while giving them a critical edge in the college admissions process, save schools time and resources, and help volunteer organizations choose quality volunteers.

                           People love to donate, but often find it inconvenient and not gratifying. We are creating an app that allows users to easily donate and interact with a wide variety of charities in a trendy and inventive way. Non-profit art organizations have a loyal following of older donors, but struggle to attract the new generation. Our app, Didomi, allows users to find a charity through the app or donate directly through a QR code, while competing and interacting with friends, bringing the gap between the non-profit organizations and the new generation looking to impact the community.

With Tacktile, we will turn student communications into an eco-friendly source of revenue for colleges throughout the nation. Tacktile will be an online bulletin board that displays virtual flyers submitted by different student groups, saving student organizations time, reducing school printing expenses, and improving student engagement through tailored messaging. We will charge student organizations a low fee to reach our large customer base of their peers, while schools receive a portion of revenue generated. Together, we will provide an eco-friendly and economical method for colleges and student organizations to communicate effectively.

                           Businesses spend around 9 billion dollars each year to sponsor and promote free events in the United States, yet the vast majority of people are unaware of these events. Teens and young adults on a budget have expressed significant interest in an app that allows them to find free events, but are frustrated by the lack of an event finding offering that tailors the results to their interests.  String is an application that allows users to find free events in their area, specialized to their interests, while allowing event promoters to advertise their events to an interested audience.

                           Our lives are consumed by our smartphones, yet people remain oblivious to the harmful effects cell phone radiation can have on their bodies, damaging brain cells daily and potentially leading to malignant tumors. During pregnancies, a fetus absorbs twice the amount of radiation compared to their mother.  Raydi is designing a radiation reducing iPhone case to protect both child and mother from this damage. With Alex’s background in graphic design, Juliette’s knowledge of marketing, and Yasmeen’s extensive scientific research, we have the background to deliver a high end, fashionable, durable, and protective iPhone case. Allow us the opportunity to help protect future generations.
